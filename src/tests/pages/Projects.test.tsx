AdMeta uses a TEE-based DID service to identify target groups for advertisers, and with the usage of TEE, AdMeta guarantees not to collect any user data. AdMeta builds multiple forms of ad assets (e.g. billboards, wall paintings) in Metaverse platforms like Decentraland, Bit.Country, to allow land holders to integrate our products easily. Qualified conversions let both users and publishers get rewards from advertisers.\n\nIn Polkadot and Kusama ecosystem, DID projects like Litentry are growing fast along with its related products. We have already discussed and agreed on our initial cooperation with Litentry. Also, we have contacted with Metaverse projects like Bit.Country, who shows great interests in cooperation as well.\n\nUnlike traditional ad platforms, who collect users sensitive data(e.g. location, browsing history) for advertising, AdMeta does not collect or store any user data per se. Instead, users voluntarily decide and control what data can be stored in TEE, and the stored data in TEE cannot be accessed by anyone except users themselves.\n\n### Project Details\n\n![AdMeta Demo - the floating billboard](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/4738254/144754078-1877d8a5-8ef9-49ec-8ef5-f79496a689f0.png)\n\nIn the above image, the floating billboard is our prototype ad component built with decentraland SDK. Users who registered on our blockchain, and switched \"Ad Display\" option on (by default it's off) are able to see a customized ad content on this billboard while gaming in decentraland.\n\nThe content of this ad component is selected according to user's personal data and preference. Unlike centralized ad platforms, we don't store user's data on or database. Instead, it's stored on the TEE layer of blockchain, and the target group matching and selecting happen also in the TEE layer, which ensures that no private data are exposed during the whole process. Eventually, both user and publisher receive some amount of token as rewards from advertiser.\n\nOur blockchain is built with Substrate, and the pallet-ad provides the functionality of advertisement proposal, storage and governance. The user pallet will connect to TEE-based external identity aggregation and DID service provided by Litentry (we have already the initial cooperation plan) to match ads with users data and preference.\n\n#### Architecture\n\n![AdMeta Architecture](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/h4n0/gists/master/admeta/admeta_architecture.svg)\n\n**Advertisers** can propose an ad with certain acceptance rule, e.g. link clicking, and also advertiser provides how many times the ads are displayed and converted, and how much they pay for each conversion. They need to pay the total price (the number of conversions \\* price per conversion) while proposing the ad. Each ad display has a unique ID, which is generated while creating the proposal. A Merkle tree are built with all these unique IDs, and the root of Merkle tree will be stored in on-chain storage. A qualified conversion gives the participated user this UID, with which the user can claim for rewards.\n\n**Councils** shall approve or reject ad proposals according to the content of ads. Also, advertisers are evaluated on their behavior democratically.\n\n**Users** can switch on the \"Ad Display\" option on AdMeta, so that users can get rewards by viewing and interacting with ads. By default, this option is off, which means users who haven't set up their AdMeta won't see any ads. Users can also provide their data for a better ad matching, by means of this they will get more rewards.\n\n**Publishers** can simply utilize our Ad Assets on any Metaverse platform and place it on their lands. Users also get rewards by a qualified display conversion.\n\n#### Technology Stack\n\n- Substrate\n- Node.js\n- 3D Model Design\n\n### Ecosystem Fit\n\nThere are an increasing number of Metaverse related projects in Polkadot/Kusama ecosystem, however, the current Metaverse platforms still lack of infrastructures and applications, comparing to our current real life. We therefore build this for various Metaverse platforms.\n\nOur target audiences can be Web3 projects, who are potential advertisers, Metaverse land holders, who are potential publishers, and Metaverse players, who are potential users.\n\nAdvertising is our natural needs in almost all social scenarios, and we meet this needs in Metaverse.\n\n[Parami](https://parami.io/) builds Web3 ad platforms as well, and their scope is to build the DID and privacy layer by themselves. While we are focusing on the advertising functionality, and the DID service will be provided by Litentry, who is more professional on this field and has already their products. Also, our ad platform is targeting on Metaverse, not Web3.\n\n## Team :busts_in_silhouette:\n\n### Team members (In order of joining time)\n\nHan Zhao - Core Dev and PM of Litentry Parachain Team.

If ads are rejected by the council(e.g. illegal or pornographic content), the advertiser's proposal bond will be slashed and collected in treasury. |\n|     2. | Substrate module: user mock | We will create a Substrate module that will first store users data on chain, to test and verify our logic. Also, user can update their data, control what data should be used, and these data are used to find the best matching ad for user.                                                                  |\n|     3. | Substrate chain             | Module ad and user can be integrated into a substrate node, to enable users access of all approved ads, receive rewards, etc. This chain will integrate treasury, council, democracy and also other essential pallets, to build a full-featured blockchain.                                                    |\n|     4. | Web App                     | We will create a web app, to let users easily interact with our substrate node. Users can claim rewards from viewing and clicking ads, and they can also configure their ad preferences and decide if they are willing to view ads or not.                                                                     |\n\n## Future Plans\n\nThe next step is to have sensitive data stored in TEE. Also, we will build more ad types, like click ads and acquisition/action ads. Meanwhile, we will implement a Chrome extension to simplify the claim process, and an Ad asset on Decentraland(or other Metaverse platform) to enable land holders to use our ad assets conveniently.\n\nIn a long run, we will cooperate and adapt our products with more Metaverse platforms, and also we will develop more creative and interactive ad types.\n\n## Additional Information :heavy_plus_sign:\n\n**How did you hear about the Grants Program?** Personal recommendation\n",
